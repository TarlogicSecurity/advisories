## Summary

Samsung Galaxy Buds and Galaxy Buds 2 are earphones that are pairable by default without requiring user interaction or a way to avoid it.


## Details

Devices fail to pass the following BSAM controls:
* [BSAM-PA-01](https://www.tarlogic.com/bsam/controls/bluetooth-device-pairing-mode/) - Pairable mode by default
* [BSAM-PA-02](https://www.tarlogic.com/bsam/controls/bluetooth-input-output-capabilities/) - Input and output capabilities
* [BSAM-PA-04](https://www.tarlogic.com/bsam/controls/bluetooth-rejection-legacy-pairing/) - Rejection of legacy pairing
* [BSAM-PA-05](https://www.tarlogic.com/bsam/controls/bluetooth-pairing-without-interaction/) - Pairing without user interaction


## Impact

This allows for device pairing without user consent nor user notification, leading to take full control of device.

As a consequence, audio playback takeover or even microphone recording without user consent or notification is achieved.


## Recommendation

There are no known fixes for the issue.
